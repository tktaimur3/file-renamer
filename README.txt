Just a simple file renamer that renames files to numbers, indicating when they were modified. So the most recently modified
file would be renamed to 1, 2nd most recently would be renamed 2, and so on. The files keep their original extension. 

Made this script partly to demonstrate some of my skills in Python. The other inspiriation came from school, where I had to submit a lot 
of images for assignments and I would number each screenshot by hand depending on what question it was (1 for first question, 2 for 2nd, etc.). 
I recently realised (way after the term ended - couldn't actually use it :P) that this meant I would create the screenshots in the 
same order as the questions were listed. So, I decided to make this script that would automate that for me. It would've been a little 
helpful if I had made it back then.
